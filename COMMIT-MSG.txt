feat: Add assistant prefill injection with ephemeral behavior

Implement automatic prefill injection from PREFILL.md with ephemeral
stripping after each API response. This allows agents to have consistent
response patterns without polluting conversation history.

Key changes:
- New module: src/agents/prefill.ts (read/strip logic)
- Modified: src/agents/pi-embedded-runner/run/attempt.ts
  - Inject prefill as assistant message before API call
  - Strip prefill from response before persisting to session
- Tests: src/agents/prefill.test.ts (9 tests, all passing)

Feature details:
- Reads PREFILL.md from agent workspace root
- Injects as assistant message on every API call
- Strips prefill portion from response after completion
- No accumulation in conversation history (ephemeral)
- Opt-in via file existence (backward compatible)

Usage:
  echo "I'll analyze this step by step." > ~/agent-workspace/PREFILL.md

Token impact:
- Input tokens increase by prefill length per turn (~400 tokens)
- No context window accumulation (stripped after each turn)

Documentation:
- PREFILL-IMPLEMENTATION.md (full implementation details)
- PREFILL-SPEC.md (original spec)

Build: ✅ pnpm build (success)
Tests: ✅ pnpm vitest prefill (9/9 passed)
